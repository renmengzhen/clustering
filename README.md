Project Overview
This repository contains Python code implementations related to the numerical experiments and examples discussed in the associated research paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00450).


Files Description:

untitled2.py: This file contains the implementation of the numerical experiments section of the paper. It includes the core computational routines and simulations used to generate the results presented in the study.

molecular.py: This file provides a standalone demo for the LiH molecule example discussed in the paper. It serves as a self-contained script to illustrate the application of the methodology to the LiH molecule case.
